On the tenth day, the task was to recreate a single frame which a miniature cathode ray tube
monitor would draw, while a sprite changes its position on the screen according to some given
instructions.

While the task itself was rather easy. The much more interesting part was that it was inspired by
the actual graphics system of the Atari 2600. Again and again i am amazed by this console, its
severe limitations and how people worked around them to create video games, albeit kind of simple
ones.
