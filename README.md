# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 coding challenges.
This year, i did all the challenges in Haskell, whereas for the last 2 years
i did some in Haskell and some in C++ (and one in Python).
I also refined the code a bit before publishing it, and included
some personal commentary.
